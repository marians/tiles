## Info on the layers

### OpenStreetMap

The international default tiles for http://openstreetmap.org/. Tiles are rendered on demand and are very up to date (frequently only several minutes behind OSM data changes).

### OpenCycleMap

Map tiles especially for bicyclers, home address: http://www.opencyclemap.org/. Created by Andy Allen and Dave Stubbs. Based on OpenStreetMap data, in addition featuring height profiles in form of contour lines. More information here: http://www.thunderforest.com/opencyclemap/

### OpenStreetMap deutscher Stil

Residing at http://www.openstreetmap.de/, this is a map style leaning towards conventions known in Germany.

### Google Maps

No need to explain. The ever-evolving Google Maps style. (c) Google plus various geodata providers.

## Google Maps Terrain

Google's style focusing more on the landscape than on streets. (c) Google plus various geodata providers. Terrain data used for hill shading seems to come from open sources, since it's identical with other terrain layers out there.

## Google Maps Satellite

This is, of course, not a map. But it's interesting for comparison, anyway.

## MapQuest Open

More info at http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/map

## MapQuest Aerial

As with Google Maps Satellite, this is not a proper map. You get the idea.

## Hike and Bike Map

Tiles for http://hikebikemap.de/, a map made for hikers and bikers. 

### Was Atmest Du

Created by Marian Steinbach for http://www.sendung.de/was-atmest-du/. It's used mainly as a background for a map of air uality measurement stations. Important roads as well as industrial areas as a possible cause for emissions are supposed to be easily visible while other features are displayed very subtly or not at all.

Tiles are statically rendered and only available for Germany.

### Offenes KÃ¶ln

Created by Marian Steinbach for http://offeneskoeln.de/ and http://offeneskoeln.de/lab/unfallkarte/ . Mainly a backdrop for data visualization, the map is supposed to use subtle colours and low contrast.

Tiles are statically rendered and only available for  the greater Cologne/Germany metropolitain area.
