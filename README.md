## Info on the layers

### Was Atmest Du

Created by Marian Steinbach for http://www.sendung.de/was-atmest-du/. It's used mainly as a background for a map of air uality measurement stations. Important roads as well as industrial areas as a possible cause for emissions are supposed to be easily visible while other features are displayed very subtly or not at all.

Tiles are statically rendered and only available for Germany.

### Offenes KÃ¶ln

Created by Marian Steinbach for http://offeneskoeln.de/ and http://offeneskoeln.de/lab/unfallkarte/ . Mainly a backdrop for data visualization, the map is supposed to use subtle colours and low contrast.

Tiles are statically rendered and only available for  the greater Cologne/Germany metropolitain area.
